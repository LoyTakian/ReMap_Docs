# Windows In Unity

## Introduction
We use the Unity Engine to develop ReMap, as it is a video game development environment, many things are present but are useless for the basic use of ReMap.

Here are the most useful Unity windows:

## Project Window

This window is used to manipulate all the apex assets and the different levels you will create.

**Attention!** Here only the folder `Levels` and `Prefabs` will be useful, don't look elsewhere, this is used for developers.

### `Levels` Folder
Is used to save your maps, to create a new one, go to the folder, right click and click on `Create/Scene`.

### `Prefabs` Folder
