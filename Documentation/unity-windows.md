# Windows In Unity

## Introduction
We use the Unity Engine to develop ReMap, as it is a video game development environment, many things are present but are useless for the basic use of ReMap.

Here are the most useful Unity windows:

## Project Window

This window is used to manipulate all the apex assets and the different levels you will create.

**Attention!** Here only the folder `Levels` and `Prefabs` will be useful, don't look elsewhere, this is used for developers.

### `Levels` Folder
Is used to save your maps, to create a new one, go to the folder, right click and click on `Create/Scene`.

### `Prefabs` Folder

This folder contains **95%** of the models of Apex legends in **Season 3**, these folders are arranged by rpak ( files that store the models ), a folder also called `all_models` contains all models

The principle is just drag and drop in your scene to put a model.

A folder also contains objects such as
* Doors
* Ziplines
* Buttons
* Triggers
* Jumppads
* Let you discover the rest

## Project Window

This window is used to manage all the objects in your map, you can and should create folders / subfolders to gather parts of your map in one.

To create an empty folder, you can right click on `Create Empty`.

You can also move them inside like in a file explorer.
